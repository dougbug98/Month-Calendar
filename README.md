# Month-Calendar
A monthly calendar created using HTML, CSS, &amp; Javascript
For this project, I developed a month-long calendar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calendar had a header that displayed the current month and date. It included all the dates of the month from 1 to 30, and the current date was accurately displayed. Everything was generated dynamically and automatically updated based on the current date and month. The calendar was visually enticing with CSS-styled effects like shadow and other design elements.
